Project Assessment:
    Cross-Solar is a backend web application created in a hurry by a startup company called “Green Energy Analytics” in Texas - USA. This application collects energy analytics data for solar panels every hour.

Notes:
    - The project accepts data for registered panels only, and to register a panel, a serial number along with latitude and longitude is required. The serial number must exact be 16 characters in length (for ex. AAAA1111BBBB2222); latitude and longitude should contain 6 decimal places and must have valid values within latitude range (-90 to 90) and longitude range (-180 to 180) respectively.
    - Frontend application is excluded from the current scope. It is a separate, fully-functioning application handled by another team, so we do not want to modify it.

Tasks:
    1) Frontend team wants to display panel’s all historical data in a chart, in which each point represents electricity generated by this panel each day [sum, min, max, average of hourly kilowatt values] up to the end of the previous day. Your goal is to implement the backend part of this task. The API specifications are already there in the code as agreed with Frontend team. Please also include unit tests for the code that write.
    2) The URLs for the API are mapped directly in the cross_solar project's urls.py, please refactor it so that the mappings are moved to api project and included from there.
    3) There are a few bugs in the application that we'd like you to fix. Even though the project might not be in a great structure, please do not spend your valuable time on structure modifications, focus on fixing bugs.
